    <p>My name is Robert Spottiswood, and this is my portfolio</p>
    <p>This website serves as a demonstration of my abilities with HTML, Javascript and CSS. This is not an exhaustive demonstration of my software development skills, but it does demonstrate my personality and experiences. The navigation bar at the top of the page will link to a series of different projects that I have created from scratch.</p>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I'm a 24 year-old professional programmer (in training). I've always wanted to create my own software from as early as I could understand the concept, and for as long as I can remember I've been tinkering with computers, trying to learn as much as I can out of pure curiosity. My life-long dream is to create a game independently, but creating software of any kind is my passion.</p>
    <p>Some of my earliest memories are of creating basic webpages with notepad and tiny programs using batch. Since then, I've experimented with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, Actionscript, C++, Python, CSV, XML, JSON, Jquery, Swift, Visual Basic, Game Maker Language, Lua, Linux, Microsoft/Open/Libre Office, the Adobe suite and a fair few other technoligies. (That's just as many as I could think of at the time of writing this).</p>
    <p>If you're interested in what games I like, I could include a similarly oversized list, but I'd much rather say what interests me about them. I love games which allow your imagination to explode; which let you delve into a world that is complex beyond understanding put propels you to try anyway. It doesn't matter whether the complexity comes from the game mechanics, the lore, character depth or even just the size of the game world. As long as the game has character, depth and/or intrigue I'll probably love it. </p>
    <p>Pressing the 'About me' page above will take you to a website that I created in a previous project at Code Nation. The first page will give you a similar description of myself to what you've already read here. Most of the information on this site is about the site itself and my progress in making it.</p>
