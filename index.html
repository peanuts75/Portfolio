    <p>My name is Robert Spottiswood, and this is my portfolio</p>
    <p>This website serves as a demonstration of my abilities with HTML, Javascript and CSS. This is not an exhaustive demonstration of my software development skills, but it does demonstrate my personality and experiences. The navigation bar at the top of the page will link to a series of different projects that I have created from scratch.</p>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I'm a 24 year-old professional programmer (in training). I've always wanted to create my own software from as early as I could understand the concept, and for as long as I can remember I've been tinkering with computers, trying to learn as much as I can out of pure curiosity. My life-long dream is to create a game independently, but creating software of any kind is my passion.</p>
    <p>Some of my earliest memories are of creating basic webpages with notepad and tiny programs using batch. Since then, I've experimented with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, Actionscript, C++, Python, CSV, XML, JSON, Jquery, Swift, Visual Basic, Game Maker Language, Lua, Linux, Microsoft/Open/Libre Office, the Adobe suite and a fair few other technoligies. (That's just as many as I could think of at the time of writing this).</p>
    <p>If you're interested in what games I like, I could include a similarly oversized list, but I'd much rather say what interests me about them. I love games which allow your imagination to explode; which let you delve into a world that is complex beyond understanding put propels you to try anyway. It doesn't matter whether the complexity comes from the game mechanics, the lore, character depth or even just the size of the game world. As long as the game has character, depth and/or intrigue I'll probably love it. </p>
    <p>Pressing the 'About me' page above will take you to a website that I created in a previous project at Code Nation. The first page will give you a similar description of myself to what you've already read here. Most of the information on this site is about the site itself and my progress in making it.</p>

    <h2>Adventure</h2>
    <p>'Adventure' is the name of my text adventure game engine. It is created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JSON. Whilst it would have been much easier to implement this without the use of JSON, and possible without even using Javascript, the implementation of JSON allows anyone to create or edit their own adventures by editing only the JSON file.</p>
    <p>The JSON file that is already in use can serve as a demo of the engine's functionality, and it's reasonably easy to adapt this file to your own adventure. An adventure's JSON file is composed of an an array of objects filled with key-value pairs**. A brief description of the values used for each of the keys used is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>title: the title of the area, shown at the top of the screen</li>
        <li>subtitle: the subtitle of the area, shown directly below the subtitle</li>
        <li>desc: short for description; the main text displayed when accessing the area</li>
        <li>(text**): when the player types the key, they will go to this area number</li>
        <li>+(text**): defines additional arguments for the area as below</li>
        <ul>
            <li>condition: checks the inventory for an item, and only reads the next line if the item is present</li>
            <li>add: adds an item to the inventory</li>
            <li>remove: removes an item from the inventory</li>
            <li>goto: the player goes to this area immediately</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>*For those who don't know what this means; the array is defined by square brackets, the objects are defined by curly brackets and the key-value pairs are keys and values seperated by colons (key: value). All keys and values must be in quotes except from goto values. A JSON file is a file with a .json filetype and syntax. </p>
    <p>**Replace text with any combination of text and numbers, as long as it is unique for the area.</p>
    
    <h2>Dice</h2>
    <p>The dice game is a simple example of a simple game, implemented using Javascript, CSS and HTML. To play the game, simply press the button that appears. Please bear in mind that this is exclusively a 2-player game. The rules are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The player indicated at the top of the page (player 1, initially) presses the button to roll the dice</li>
        <li>Repeat step 1 until the player rolls a 1 or has rolled a total of 20 this round</li>
        <li>If the player has rolled a 1, they have lost the round and it is the next player's turn starting at step 1</li>
        <li>If the player has totalled 20, they have won the round and it is the next player's turn starting at step 1</li>
        <li>If all both have played this round, the round is over</li>
        <li>There are no success, failure or end conditions, but the winner at any point in time is the player with the highest number of wins</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Players are able to create their own win conditions, but ultimately this is a game without an ending. This is a simple project and didn't take a long time to create, but I'm still somewhat proud of it.</p>

    <h2>Virtual Pet</h2>
    <p>The virtual pet project is a simple implementation of a virtual pet. The virtual pet in question is a dragon, whom you can feed, gift, clean, play with, talk to or check.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feed: choose an item to feed to the dragon</li>
        <li>Gift: choose an item to gift to the dragon</li>
        <li>Clean: choose an way to clean the dragon</li>
        <li>Play: choose a way to play with the dragon</li>
        <li>Talk: choose a topic to discuss with the dragon</li>
        <li>Check: look at the dragon and guage their mood</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For each action you take, you're prompted with three potential ways to take this action. Each of these actions will have an effect on the dragon's mood, being either positive, negative or neutral. There will be a description of the effect the action had on the dragon, but ultimately the best way to guage your dragon's mood will be to check on them.</p>
