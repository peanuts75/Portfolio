        <div class="question"><p>Describe the content and layout for each page.</p></div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The layout of my site is somewhat unconventional, but has a clear and intuitive layout which should be easy to navigate, read and understand. Effectively, it consists of a title, subtitle, body of text and navigation panel.</p>
            <p>The title is written in large font, centrally aligned at the top of the page so that it’s attention catching and clear. Underneath it is the subtitle, which is written smaller as it’s actually redundant thanks to the navigation panel. The only reason that the subtitle is there at all is actually for aesthetic appeal.</p>
            <p>The main body of text is aligned to the left since that’s how english speakers are generally used to reading bodies of text, but it’s separated from the sides of the page so that the text is slightly easier to see and isn’t in danger of being cut-off.</p>
            <p>The navigation panel is a simple (if somewhat cumbersome) series of buttons which adjusts to the size of the page and has a border around the currently selected page. I have found that being able to pick from the available pages without requiring additional clicks or menus makes it much more accessible. Although the panel does require scrolling to the bottom of the page to use, it is somewhat of an aesthetic feature of the page and I consider this worth the sacrifice in access time, especially coupled with its accessibility.</p>
            <p>A feature which I’ve given significant attention to is the minimum screen size of the viewer’s device. The minimum screen width to view the site is 756 pixels, which is well above the average for android devices and monitors, and above the average for apple devices too. There’s no minimum resolution for vertical height, so nearly all modern devices can display the website with no issues whatsoever. This has been tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari.</p>
