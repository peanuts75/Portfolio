        <div class="question"><p>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</p></div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>IT is vast and ever-expanding, and the tools are just as rapidly growing. I’ve already mentioned just how many different pieces of technology there are, but it’s worth reviewing your experience with your tools from time to time.</p>
            <p>Firstly, the computers themselves were somewhat surprising since I haven’t really used a Mac before. A pleasant surprise, though! They’re pretty swift and even if they’re lacking in some areas, they excel in others. I didn’t have any issues making the transition to Mac, and I’d consider switching if it weren’t for the cost and lower compatibility.</p>
            <p>The software is probably more interesting though, because Trello and Visual Studio Code have been invaluable. Trello has kept me on track as much as possible without physically taking control of me. Visual Studio Code is a fantastic environment which I’ll certainly use again in the future. Both of these programs have an impressive minimalist approach whilst still maintaining extensive functionality, and they’re both free!</p>
