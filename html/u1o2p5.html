            <p>To make a website that reaches my own standards (and yours!) I had to make sure that the site (at the very least) works. To start with, I need to make sure that the page works without any kind of bugs, and that mostly just means testing.</p>
            <p>I’ve been pretty lucky with this project in not encountering many bugs, but by testing the website regularly I can spot them early and squash them with ease by revising the code as I make changes.</p>
            <p>As long as the page actually works, I can ensure that the presentation is thematically appropriate. The site is intended to be semi-formal with some of my personality, and that means that I can experiment with creating a nice theme. A lot of the work I’ve put into the project was actually in designing the site and improving the aesthetics. It was very important to me that the site should show my own personality through visual appeal, which is what lead to this somewhat slick aesthetic.</p>
