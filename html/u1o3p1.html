            <br><h6>Unit 1 - Outcome 3.1</h6></div>
        <div class="question"><p>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency.</p></div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I’m pretty happy with how well the project turned out and I don’t think that I was unproductive or inefficient. Regardless, there’s always more that can be done to improve upon both.</p>
            <p>Using a Mac, for example, was not something I was accustomed to and getting used to the new hardware and operating system took some time. It didn’t take a lot of time, granted, but it still could have been faster if I were able to use the same keyboard shortcuts as on a Windows PC.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, once I was used to the Mac I was able to perform almost as quickly as when using a Windows PC. For what Macs lack in familiarity, they make up for in swift maneuverability.</p>
            <p>I was already accustomed to Trello, so there was no real need to relearn functionality, and the other applications that I used were also very familiar. Visual Studio Code is fairly similar to a program that I’ve used in the past, called Visual Studio. Notice the identical name?</p>
            <p>I imagine it could have been faster to utilise a team for this project, but frankly I believe that this project benefitted from not having a team. I believe that there are times when the best results can come from a single person, and that this was one of those times.</p>
