        <div class="question"><p>Describe the purpose of IT in modern business.</p></div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Technology has always been somewhat of a focal point for human culture, as we have always been creating new technologies and utilising it to the benefit of mankind. We used to consider an especially sharp rock to be a tool, then we learned to smelt, then to create computers, then how to make rockets that reach the moon. We’ve literally been shooting for the stars, and whether you hate it or love it we’re now firmly in the digital age.</p>
            <p>The downside to having such sophisticated technology is that if we choose not to use it, we’re often quickly overtaken by others that do use it. In the business world, it would be completely unrealistic to run a company using stone-age technology, but using an experienced team with heavy software experience that same team can do things that no other age could comprehend.</p>
            <p>A company with digital technology can contact one another practically instantly from opposite sides of the globe, transferring extraordinarily large amounts of data to one another, even collaborating on the same project without having met one another in the flesh. Considering that this kind of technology is fast becoming the standard, it’s necessary to embrace it or falling behind is guaranteed. Even with a business consisting of one person, today’s technology can radically improve that person’s self-management, social accessibility and countless other aspects of their trade.</p>
