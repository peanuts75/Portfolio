            <p>A couple of applications that I know I’ll be using for any web development projects, thanks to a good combination of virtues, are Trello, Visual Studio Code and Google Chrome.</p>
            <p>Trello is an online project management app which is available for free, easy to use, feature rich, and I’ve had prior experience using it to complete projects. It’s always essential to use a project management tool of some sort as the difference in organisation can be monumental, even when there’s only one person involved in the project. If nothing else, it’s a useful place to place reminders and see what you need to do next.</p>
            <p>Visual Studio Code is the main program that I’m using to create the end result, as it is a software development program which is suitable for HTML, the language which web pages use. Generally, there will be a main tool for whatever project you’re involved in, even if that tool is your project management tool.</p>
            <p>Google Chrome is the web browser that I’ll be using to test this website, and it’s always important to test any software that you develop as it’s otherwise impossible to know what kind of issues the end user will receive. In fact, it’s often important to test what you’re creating regularly even if you’re not developing software as humans and machines do not read and write in the same language and you might disagree with one another, creating issues that you wouldn’t notice without testing.</p>
            <p>Working with software development, a widely accepted standard is called Git, Git and Github are used for version control, to identify, branch and update your software as it’s in development. A branch, in Git, is a separate course of development for the software which means that one course of development can involve certain changes whilst the other branch is completely unaffected. This is particularly helpful with experimental builds, as it means that those who need a stable build of the program have access to it, as do those who don’t need the stability and instead want to see the bleeding edge of the app’s development.</p>
