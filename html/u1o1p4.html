        <div class="question"><p>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects.</p></div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Technology isn’t magic. That’s effectively a lot of why digital project’s fail; people often expect computers to do the impossible and don’t understand what is truly required or how to get the required result. If you’re going to use a computer, you need to understand that it requires input to create output, and that input is something you’ll always need to account for.</p>
            <p>To make a digital project, you’ll have to plan it out and ensure that you have the resources, skills, knowledge and technology to execute it. Of course, this can be done before or during the project, but it’s much more efficient to do so before the project so that you can devote more time and resources towards this.</p>
            <p>Project management is also, of course, of paramount importance. This can involve making sure that any teammates are assigned to tasks in order to divide the workload, setting deadlines to certain parts of the project, adding reminders of tasks to be done or ensuring that tasks are not completed multiple times unnecessarily among other possibilities. Good project management can be the difference between missing several deadlines with an underdeveloped project and completing the project well ahead of schedule with a well polished project.</p>
