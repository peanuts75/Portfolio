        <div class="question"><p>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</p></div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>There’s a lot that can be done to improve efficiency, but I don’t think there’s much that applies to this situation. In general, I’d advise a healthy sleep routine, eating properly and some self-care to make sure that you’re in the best condition you can be in, that’s one of the more important ways to ensure that you can be productive.</p>
            <p>Generally, we’re also better at getting down to work when we’re in a familiar situation, because the unfamiliar is capable of slowing us down. Because of that, using familiar technology is key to avoiding the feelings of ‘I don’t know what I’m doing here’ or ‘I don’t know how to keep going like this’. Even when your eyes are drawn just to a computer for the majority of the project, the environment is still important in the same way, and can help you maintain a productive headspace.</p>
            <p>Personally, I feel that the main way I would improve my own productivity is to remove the distractions which would often halt my momentum. It’s not always possible to do this, and it generally wasn’t in the course of this project, but outside influences can easily disrupt a productive headspace. In this situation, there was construction work outside which was particularly loud and unhelpful. It’s not really a problem that I could solve. The best I could achieve was to move to a quieter area, which I did frequently.</p>
