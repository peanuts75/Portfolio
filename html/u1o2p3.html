            <p>Am I happy with my website? Well, it could always be a little better, there are always little faults that could have been prevented or perfected, but otherwise I’d say that I’m pretty proud of what I’ve created.</p>
            <p>The website is somewhat simplistic thanks to its minimalist theme, it doesn’t even have any images, but I’ve experimented with different ways to create gradients and have elements interact with other elements. It hasn’t been easy, but I’ve learned things during the creation of the site and I think that’s an important part of creating anything.</p>
            <p>The most significant detraction from the site is the way that the navigation panel at the bottom of the screen moves around depending on the page that the user’s on, which means that they have to scroll in order to access their desired button in some cases. It’s something that I could have avoided, but not without rethinking the overall site layout. I was happy enough with the site layout that I didn’t want to make that sacrifice.</p>
            <p>The part I’m most proud of and consider my best work is the use of backgrounds. There are no images on the site as I’ve said previously, instead I’ve used gradients upon gradients as background layers, with transparency and alternative layering modes. The end result of this is somewhat complex and difficult to explain, but amounts to a minimalist and stylish theme that shows my favourite colour (purple, if you couldn’t tell) proudly throughout the site. </p>
