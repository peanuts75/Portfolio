        <div class="question"><p>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects.</p></div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>One important aspect to mention when creating any kind of digital project is the legality involved. Even when you think what you’ve created is all your own work, remember that it was made using a program that someone created, on an operating system that someone created, on hardware that someone created. Generally speaking, the hardware isn’t relevant, but any software that you’ve used is a potential risk for legal issues if you don’t acquire the relevant licences. This can be avoided by using software that doesn’t require licensing, but the term ‘you get what you pay for’ may be in effect if all the software you use is totally free.</p>
            <p>Also, ‘Free’ can mean ‘free to use without distribution’, ‘free to distribute with certain attachments’ or ‘free to modify and distribute’ among others. There are a variety of different licences with different restrictions on what you can do with that software, and if you invalidate the licence then you’re using it illegally. You must always ensure that the licences you have are suitable for what you want to do with them.</p>
            <p>As the world adapts to modern technology, the law and regulations are still catching up and new rules or guidelines are being still being released. It’s important to keep track of what is and isn’t illegal, such as the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/data-protection">Data Protection Act</a> and the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing/all-you-need-know-about-gdpr-new-data-law/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> which vary upon where the data is located. An example that is present in both of these examples is that data associated with individuals must be stored and used only when necessary, a precaution which can help to minimise data theft such as credit card information.</p>
